# Just Clipboard Manager

##### Problems:
- Sequential `Ctrl + Shift + V` (or other hot key) usage without result returning.
- To fast sequential `Ctrl + Shift + V` (or other hot key) usage (especially on first paste window request).
- Delete individual clip -> then press Esc key -> some clip will be pasted.
